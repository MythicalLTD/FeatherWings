          The amount of time in seconds that can elapse before a server's disk space calculation is
          considered stale and a re-check should occur. DANGER: setting this value too low can seriously
          impact system performance and cause massive I/O bottlenecks and high CPU usage for the Wings
          process.

          Set to 0 to disable disk checking entirely. This will always return 0 for the disk space used
          by a server and should only be set in extreme scenarios where performance is critical and
          disk usage is not a concern.
